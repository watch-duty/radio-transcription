## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: Emit structured logs for every newly inserted `feed_audit_events` row.
- [Phase 1]: Do not add direct WD calls, DB polling, DB triggers, LISTEN/NOTIFY, CDC, outbox payload tables, or delivery state in the feed write path.
- [Phase 2]: Use Cloud Logging sink to Pub/Sub with a DLQ capped at 10 delivery attempts.
- [Phase 3]: Use a Cloud Run relay to forward flat audit payloads to the Watch Duty webhook.
