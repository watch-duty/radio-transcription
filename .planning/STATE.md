# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-06-14)

**Core value:** On-call should be alerted only when the quarantined feed is
likely something a human can fix at feed scope.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Policy And Storage Foundation

## Current Position

Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- V1 reuses `status='failing'` with `failure_count=0` for suppressed retry.
- `quarantine_reason` remains forensic only and cannot drive policy.
- Durable replay, source-class breakers, and persistent audit tables are v2.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `.planning/` is ignored by repo `.gitignore`; planning docs are force-added
  when committed.
- Full local E2E/integration stacks are resource-heavy; use narrow tests unless
  the user explicitly asks for broader validation.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Replay | Durable publish outbox/hold-replay worker | Deferred to v2 | Initialization |
| Breakers | Source-class/credential breaker state | Deferred to v2 | Initialization |
| Audit | Persistent structured failure event table | Deferred to v2 | Initialization |
| Runtime | Echo parity | Deferred to follow-up | Initialization |
