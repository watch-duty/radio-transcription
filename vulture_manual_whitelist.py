# Manual Vulture Whitelist
# This file contains unused code/symbols that we intentionally keep in the codebase.
# Unlike vulture_whitelist.py, this file is maintained manually and WILL NOT be
# overwritten when running 'mise run lint:dead-code:update'.
# Please add detailed comments for why each entry is kept.

# MockCacheProvider is a mock implementation of CacheProvider used in integration and unit tests.
# Vulture excludes test directories (**/tests/**, **/test_*.py) from analysis, so it misses
# the imports of this class in tests, falsely flagging it as dead code.
